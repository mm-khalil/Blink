# ROS_Blink
ROS_Serial_ARduino program to Blink LED

In ROS: 
we start from a very basic in beginning and then goes to some high level of complexity thatâ€™s why  I started from easy level to Blink a bullet in Led on Arduino.
Basically I write a publisher in Arduino IDE which is sent to Arduino Controller and it act as a subscriber and follow commands which are mentioned in Programming and then compile a code and perform the task.
